## TIBCO Data Science on AWS

This Quick Start automatically deploys TIBCO Data Science into a customizable environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy the TIBCO Data Science platform in your AWS account. The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying TIBCO Data Science into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying TIBCO Data Science into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
